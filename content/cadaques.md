On my way home, taking advantage of one of many Spanish public holidays, I decided to stop in Figueres and from there start a hike. It was easy to find the perfect spot for a two days hike: [**Cap de Creus** National Park](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/42.2920/3.2236). From the TGV train station it was pretty easy to find a bus to Roses. My itinerary was set, I would hike from Roses to Cadaqués through the hills and along the coast. I hopped in the first bus. When I arrived in Roses I looked up for some information, I wanted to buy a map to help me to navigate through the national park. Unfortunately and like many cities in Spain, most of the shops are closed on Sundays. Fortunately the tourism center was open and I could get two rough maps of the area. I didn't want to waste more time, I bought two liters of water and I was set to go.

After hoping off the bus and walking straight down to the beach, I had wandered a bit to find information. Not much though I was still near the wide beach of Roses. Adjusting the stripes of my backpack I soon considered a great idea. Why not starting the hike **barefoot**? Not really a question... My shoes in my hand, I started to walk in the sand. I personally love the feeling although it makes it a bit more difficult to walk. All around me people where enjoying a sunny day at the beach, beach volley, frisbee, and other sand activities. After around 45 minutes I reached the end of the beach. I kept walking barefoot mostly because I really enjoy it and partly because of laziness. Unfortunately after another 20 minutes, the asphalt trail turned into a dirt trail and the proximity of spiky grasses forced me to pause and put my shoes back on.
