Hello everybody,

First of all, thank you for visiting my blog. Maybe some of you landed on this blog by accident, or you have been invited to follow my travels adventures. For those who discovered this website on their own, I need to introduce myself.

My name is Etienne, I just finished a bachelor in Biology. Following a placement in a French research laboratory, I gave up the idea of becoming a researcher. That's why I'm taking a full year on the other side of the world in New-Zealand! Here, I can take the time of thinking about my future.

Determined to fully enjoy this experience, when I left France I packed camping stuff, camera, writing stuff and drawing stuff. All these things are part of my way to create memories, it'll allow you to follow my journey. I carry also this computer which permit me to write you and manage my pictures.

Here you will find the breakdown of my travel. Don't hesitate to talk to me, to act upon this blog or tell me any suggestion.

Have a good reading !

PS : sorry for mistakes my English is not perfect...
