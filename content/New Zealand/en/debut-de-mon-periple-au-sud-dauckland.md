Le texte français suit le texte anglais, la raison de sa présence sur
mon blog est ma volonté de partager mes expériences avec des gens
rencontré sur la route, ici en Nouvelle-Zélande. Ce schéma se reproduira
systématiquement je pense.

*After the world cup opening I decided to take the road, again. My road
trip to the south began.*

*My first stop was in Raglan, a really famous surf spot. Sadly the
weather didn't allow me to do a lot of surfing. The strong wind was
flattened the wawes and created some side waves. In these condition
surfing was really hard, moreover when the wind bring you into a strong
current which lead far away from the coast. As the weather didn't get
better the two next days I'd just enjoy one surfing afternoon.*

*Unable to surf, I took the time to do my laundry but that was the first
time I was seeing a laundry dry so slowly... Three days after my clothes
was still wet... It was because of the rainy weather : at less three or
four hours rain a day. That was impossible for me to stay inside, even
if this weather was perfectly fitting for that. So i decided to do some
walks around my backpacker. The first one was a little walk into the
bush around my accomodation, the other one, longer was giving up because
of the rain (not because I was afraid of that, but my clothes was drying
outside...). Without more delay I offer you the photos (see after the
french text).*
