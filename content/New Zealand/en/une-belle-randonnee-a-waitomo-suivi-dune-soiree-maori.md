*Hi everybody,*

*This is my second english article on this blog, don't hesitate,
encourage me to continue to write in english. This time the story take
place in Waimoto with its caves "World renowned", so as usual a lot of
my bus mates decide to visit these caves. To tell the truth I was
starting to feel bored by all these turistic stuffs. Moreover these
caves didn't appear to be wonderful, there were no mention of beautiful
stalactite or stalagmite. So I decide to do anything else. That's why I
come to the information site and ask gently at the cute girl behind the
desk. I said her that I'm looking for a four hour walk around Waimoto.
She quickly answer me there is just next to the building a start for a
historical site : "a maori Pa". For those who don't know what's a Pa
there is the definition : "it's a moari fortification often build at the
top of a hill which contain the village and all the food supplies". But
the walk was only one hour return. So I ask for a longer walk. After a
short thinking she open a cupbord behind her, and give me a rough map of
the surrounding. The map, hand-drawing was showing a 2 hours and a half
walk, just what I needed.I went out the I-site, and walking fast I
started the historical site walk. After 20 minutes ascent I discovered
the site. Indeed and in spite of the absence of ruin, I could see the
relics of an ancient Pa (see the photos). As the employee warned me
about the mud which could slow me during the long walk I hurry up,
running during the descent. On my way back I passed the bus and go along
the road to the start of my second walk. The bus pass me five minutes
before I reach the start of my hike. And four germans and one french
asked me if they can join me. That was a mistake to accept... They were
so slow, without any hiking shoes, neither a habit in walking. Of course
their feet were quickly wet because of the mud and they constantly
slipped on the mud. After two rains and 45 minutes moving forward to
cross only 2 km. I turned over and told them : "sorry I let you here,
you're to slow and if I want to see the end of the walk I really need to
walk faster". You could see on the last photos how this
payed.*

*After this long walk we went in the bus : direction Maketu and the
Uncle Boys retreat. I told this night shortly because the pitcures will
show you better than every words. We learn the Haka while the girls was
learning a dancing song. We share a meal and we sleep altogether (26)
into the hall. After that I get on with a group of singapourians whith
which I'd played card until late. I want to say them (we don't know
perhaps they will read that) that I was really please to meet them.
Don't worry I will speak much longer about them in a next article !
And... I almost forget : thanks to the german we didn't sleep really
long.*
