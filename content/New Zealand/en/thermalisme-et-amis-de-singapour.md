*After walking around Waitomo
and learned the Haka, the bus lead me to a little village near Rotorua.
In this area, there is a lot of volcanic activities, you can see it from
far and almost everywhere because there is hot springs which spread
white clouds. As a side activity the driver offer us to do a guided tour
around a village called Whakarewarewa (pronunced : fakarewrewa). Without
hesitate really long I decide do to this. At 9am the visit started, we
were only four, a kind german mate and two french (I didn't really speak
with them so I don't know how they were). The german girl (who was
obviously pretty, next time don't ask me because the answer will not
change) and me have enjoy the visit. As you could see on the few
pictures below there were a lot of different pool. A few were warm, used
as baths surrounded by hot rocks (I sat on one of them but after ten
minutes I must stood up to avoid a burned injury); others were really
hot, used as cooking pool (more than 80°C). There was also some steamy
oven were villagers could cook some pie, meat or everything else that
you can cook in a oven. The big advantage of these oven is that your
food can't burn because of the steam. I taste some meals from one steamy
oven and one cooking pool : that was really good with a strange but
delicious suffer taste. Moreover it's a really lazy way to cook, you
mustn't stay near the cooking pool or the oven, you just have to put it
in, go away, and come back fifteen or more minutes later. All this hot
water created a unique way of life in this village ! The others pictures
show you the geysers in the village, some coloured dry mud, mud pool,
and several views of this little village (only sixty people live in).
After the guided tour I spent another hour with the german girl speaking
on deep topic such as the economic crysis in europe.*

*Sadly all good thing comes to an end... (nono I'm not speaking about
this german girl, stop thinking about that !) Again the bus, the road
and my first thermal bath ! Here I can thanks Shannie for the few
pictures where you can see me in water.*

*Next, we arrived in Taupo, just the time to do some stupid photos with
my favorites Singaporians people, to buy some food and to eat some
pizza. I was thinking that Singaporians were shy as usually are asians,
but trust that's not true... Shannie was inquiring in all aspect of my
emotional life. Back to the backpacker I would like to go out but that
wasn't shared with my three nights friends, so it ended playing card
like yesterday in Maketu. And finally the next morning they leave me
alone in Taupo, make me feel sad to lost three nights friends for the
first time since I began my travel... That's why I hope to see you soon
in Singapore : Shannie, Alex, Liangjue, Janelle and Julyn !*

*Kiss from Wellington to all of you !*
